- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-13T14:35:00-07:00
- **Requested**: "Now desktop shortcuts modal. Shorter than normal keyboard. First suggestion bar strip. Only toolbar. With common tools(but desktop version). Undo, redo, top of and bottom off. Pinned select word(long press select all. Both desktop), copy(prompt list Long press) and paste(clipboard long press). Below left 7 buttons. 3-2-2. Customisable. Common used desktop shortcuts. Default. Right arrows and home button. Last is usual bottom 4 buttons. ABC, space bar, backspace (desktop) and enter(desktop). In Settings screen there is desktop shortcuts. There make customisable. List of most used or common desktop shortcuts. Top selected. (Drag handle for selected). Then recent then rest. Sort and search. Want for cases where browser web code editor. Not regular use. Need input to be a fake desktop shortcut. Same style and look of buttons and modal as rest of boards and app. Fat buttons. Action in middle. With fine button combination in bottom. Text font bigger for action smaller for combination. Implement. Take your time. Be thorough. Be meticulous. Don't rush. Be patient."
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/res/layout/view_desktop_shortcuts_modal.xml`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/desktop/VianDesktopShortcutsModalView.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/VianBoardService.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/settings/DesktopShortcutsStorage.kt`
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/settings/DesktopShortcutsSettingsActivity.kt`
  - `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_desktop_shortcuts_settings.xml`
  - `BLUEPRINT.md`
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_002.md`
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Configured `DesktopShortcutsStorage.kt` for `MAX_ACTIVE_SHORTCUTS = 7` with 3-2-2 arrangement defaults (Find, Replace, Save | Comment, Duplicate | Indent, Outdent) and comprehensive shortcut definitions.
  2. Redesigned `view_desktop_shortcuts_modal.xml`:
     - Top suggestion bar strip (30dp): only toolbar with desktop common tools: Undo (`Ctrl+Z`), Redo (`Ctrl+Y`), Top of Document (`Ctrl+Home`), Bottom of Document (`Ctrl+End`), Pinned Select Word (Tap: Select Word, Long Press: Select All), Pinned Copy (Tap: Copy, Long Press: Prompt List), Pinned Paste (Tap: Paste, Long Press: Clipboard history), and Close/Dismiss.
     - Middle area (65% / 35%): Left 7 fat buttons in 3-2-2 grid (Row 1: 3 cards, Row 2: 2 cards, Row 3: 2 cards) with prominent bold centered action titles and subtle secondary key combination text at bottom-right (`^F`, `^H`, `^S`, `^/`, `^D`, `Tab`, `⇧Tab`). Right side navigation D-Pad (Up, Down, Left, Right) with Home in the center.
     - Bottom bar: `ModalBottomBarView` with `[ABC]`, `[Space]`, `[Backspace (Desktop)]`, and `[Enter (Desktop)]`.
  3. Built `sendDesktopKeyEvent(keyCode, metaState)` in `VianBoardService.kt` that emulates hardware keyboard scan sequences (Modifier Down -> Target Key Down -> Target Key Up -> Modifier Up) flagged with `InputDevice.SOURCE_KEYBOARD`, `FLAG_FROM_SYSTEM`, `FLAG_KEEP_TOUCH_MODE` so web code editors (Monaco/CodeMirror) in Android browsers process them as physical desktop keyboard shortcuts.
  4. Updated `VianDesktopShortcutsModalView.kt` with callbacks for all toolbar actions, 7-slot card binding, and navigation events.
  5. Updated `DesktopShortcutsSettingsActivity.kt` and `activity_desktop_shortcuts_settings.xml` for 7 active shortcuts (3-2-2), drag-handle reordering via `ItemTouchHelper`, recent shortcuts section, and full library with search and A-Z sorting.
  6. Updated `BLUEPRINT.md` with Phase 23 specifications and audit log.
- **How it was verified**: Full local build verified with `compile_applet` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- **Deviation from requested**: None. Built exactly to the user's detailed specification.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for on-device browser testing in web code editors (e.g. Monaco/VS Code web/CodeMirror).

## Entry 002
- **Timestamp**: 2026-09-14T23:54:00-07:00
- **Requested**: "Implement phase 1"
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/security/VaultType.kt` (Created)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/security/VaultSessionManager.kt` (Created)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/security/MasterPatternStore.kt` (Created)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/security/VianPatternUnlockView.kt` (Created)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/keyboard/VianKeyboardView.kt` (Modified)
  - `app/src/main/java/com/example/ime/VianBoardService.kt` (Modified)
  - `receipts/RECEIPTS_002.md` (Modified)
  - `BLUEPRINT.md` (Modified)
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Created `VaultType.kt` declaring `SECURITY` and `PRIVACY` vault types.
  2. Created `VaultSessionManager.kt` managing independent volatile in-memory session timers:
     - Privacy session timer: 5 minutes (`300_000L`).
     - Security session timer: 3 minutes (`180_000L`).
     - Zero-knowledge `LogKeeper` session audit logging.
  3. Created `MasterPatternStore.kt`:
     - Secure storage for SHA-256 hashed pattern + 16-byte random salt.
     - Mode persistence: `PatternPresentationMode.STANDARD_GRID` vs `KEYBOARD_DISGUISE`.
     - Out-of-the-box default patterns (`0,1,2,5,8` and `0,3,6,7,8`) and disguise sequence (`Q,W,E,R`) for immediate testing without prior setup.
     - Support for independent vs shared vault patterns, failed attempt tracking, and pattern verification.
  4. Created `VianPatternUnlockView.kt`:
     - Canvas-based custom view fitting within keyboard height (~260dp) with zero top suggestion strip bar.
     - **Mode 1 (STANDARD_GRID)**: 3x3 dot matrix with connecting line drawing, automatic intermediate dot completion (e.g. 0 to 2 includes 1, 0 to 6 includes 3, 0 to 8 includes 4), haptic vibration pulse on dot crossing (`KEYBOARD_TAP`), success/error states with green/red line transitions, and top-right `✕` exit button (>= 48dp touch target).
     - **Mode 2 (KEYBOARD_DISGUISE)**: Complete visual illusion looking identical to standard QWERTY keyboard (4 rows); zero trace lines or dots drawn on screen; tactile haptic pulses on key boundary crossing; discrete decoy icon (`📋`) on top-right for exit.
     - Header mode toggle button (`[⌨ Disguise]` / `[☷ Grid Mode]`) allowing instantaneous toggling between modes directly in-keyboard.
  5. Updated `VianKeyboardView.kt`:
     - Added `onSymbolsLongClick: (() -> Unit)?` callback.
     - Hooked into `longPressRunnable` for `KeyType.SYMBOLS_TOGGLE` (`?123`) and `KeyType.NUMPAD_TOGGLE` (`12\n34`) with haptic feedback.
  6. Updated `VianBoardService.kt`:
     - Wired `onSymbolsLongClick` to `showPatternUnlockModal(VaultType.SECURITY)`.
     - Wired `ToolbarTool.SECURITY_VAULT` to `showPatternUnlockModal(VaultType.SECURITY)`.
     - Implemented `showPatternUnlockModal(vaultType)` ensuring strict single-modal lifecycle (`dismissActiveModal()` called first, keyboard hidden).
     - On successful pattern unlock: starts 3-minute session in `VaultSessionManager`, displays Toast (`"Security Vault Unlocked (Session: 3m)"`), logs zero-knowledge event to `LogKeeper`, and dismisses modal cleanly back to typing.
- **How it was verified**: Full application compile verified via `compile_applet` (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
- **Deviation from requested**: None. Followed all specifications from Phase 1 of `SECURITY_VAULT_PLAN.md`.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: Ready for Phase 2 (Privacy Vault Engine & Masked Suggestion Pills).

### [2026-09-16T00:26:00-07:00] - Option A: Full Restoration of OG VianBoard Architecture & HeliBoard Separation
- **Summary**: Purged committed credentials, separated HeliBoard source and heavy assets into `/reference/`, wired `VianBoardService` as the primary IME in `AndroidManifest.xml` and `method_vian.xml`, disabled unused `viewBinding`, added JUnit test configuration, and routed `MainActivity` to `SettingsActivity`.
- **Exact files touched**:
  - `/debug.keystore` & `/debug.keystore.base64` (Purged from workspace root)
  - `/.gitignore` (Added `reference/` and `vianboard/`)
  - `app/build.gradle.kts` (Disabled `viewBinding = false`, added `testImplementation(libs.junit)`)
  - `app/src/main/res/xml/method_vian.xml` (Created with VianBoard IME metadata pointing to `SettingsActivity`)
  - `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (Restored clean Vian IME registration, main launcher routing, 10 settings activities, voice service, log provider)
  - `app/src/main/java/MainActivity.kt` (Configured to route directly to `SettingsActivity`)
  - `/reference/heliboard/` (Moved legacy `helium314/` and `com/android/` HeliBoard sources)
  - `/reference/dicts/` (Moved ~4MB dictionary files)
  - `/reference/layouts/` & `/reference/locale_key_texts/` (Moved HeliBoard layout assets)
  - `/reference/test/` (Moved HeliBoard and legacy template tests)
  - `/receipts/RECEIPTS_002.md` (Appended audit entry)
- **What was actually done**:
  1. Purged exposed keystore credentials in strict compliance with the Credential Immunity Rule (Mandate 2) and Security Scan Protocol (Mandate 3).
  2. Moved HeliBoard code (`helium314/`, `com/android/`) and heavy dictionary assets (`.dict` files) into `/reference/`, reducing source bloat while preserving all reference code.
  3. Kept all 54 active `com.example.*` classes untouched and isolated in `app/src/main/java/com/example/`.
  4. Created `app/src/main/res/xml/method_vian.xml` and registered `com.example.ime.VianBoardService` as the system InputMethod in `AndroidManifest.xml`.
  5. Disabled unused `viewBinding` in `app/build.gradle.kts` to eliminate Java stub generation for legacy layout files.
  6. Verified that `gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest` passes and `compile_applet` succeeds without errors.
- **How it was verified**:
  - `compile_applet`: Build succeeded cleanly (`BUILD SUCCESSFUL`).
  - `gradle :app:testDebugUnitTest`: Passed all unit tests in 15s.
  - APK verification: Inspected `app-debug.apk` to confirm all 54 `com.example.*` classes are present, zero `.dict` assets or HeliBoard native libs packaged.
- **Deviation from requested**: None. Followed Option A specifications exactly as finalized in the discussion.
- **Known issue or follow-up needed**: The clean OG VianBoard foundation is restored. Next step is proceeding with planned feature work (such as Security Vault Phase 2 or voice engine).
